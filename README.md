# PBL-Project
I. Introduction to Problem (What, Why, How)
What:
The field of cybersecurity faces increasingly complex and diverse threats, demanding constant innovation in security operations. Security Operations Centers (SOC) are the first line of defense in detecting and mitigating these threats. However, many smaller organizations or individuals interested in cybersecurity lack the resources to build a robust, scalable, and cost-effective SOC. To bridge this gap, the SOC Automation Lab project enables the creation of an automated SOC using open-source tools like Wazuh, The Hive, and Shuffle. This lab is designed to simulate real-world SOC workflows and automate security tasks, providing an immersive and practical environment for learning.
Why:
Cybersecurity professionals, particularly those aiming to work in SOCs, need hands-on experience with the tools, techniques, and workflows commonly used in the industry. With increasing demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals, candidates with real-world, practical experience are more likely to impress hiring managers. This project, designed with scalability and flexibility in mind, offers an accessible way to simulate SOC operations, integrate security tools, and automate response workflows—all at no cost.
Furthermore, in a world where threats evolve rapidly, automating incident response and integrating multiple tools into a cohesive system is essential for improving efficiency and minimizing human error. This lab not only fosters technical skills but also builds confidence in designing and managing SOC environments, making it an essential learning tool for both newcomers and experienced cybersecurity professionals.
How:
The project involves a step-by-step approach to setting up a SOC automation lab using Wazuh for monitoring and logging, The Hive for case management, and Shuffle for automation. The entire setup is cloud-based, making it accessible to users regardless of their hardware. By integrating these tools, users will gain exposure to real-time threat detection, incident management, and automated response workflows.
This project includes the following:
1.	Setup and Configuration: Installing Wazuh, The Hive, and Shuffle, configuring them to work together, and ensuring that the lab operates smoothly.
2.	Automation and Response: Creating automated workflows for handling security incidents, including active responses like blocking malicious IPs or sending email alerts to security analysts.
3.	Mentorship and Learning Resources: Providing step-by-step video guides, diagrams, and mentorship to assist learners in completing the setup and gaining hands-on experience.
This project is application-based, as it focuses on creating a practical, hands-on cybersecurity lab that can be used to simulate a real-world SOC environment.

To make your SOC automation lab more unique and comprehensive, you can incorporate advanced features that enhance both its functionality and its value as a learning tool. Here are several features and enhancements you can consider adding to your SOC lab:
1. Threat Intelligence Integration
•	Integration with Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs): Incorporate open-source or commercial Threat Intelligence Platforms such as MISP, OpenDXL, or ThreatConnect. This would allow your SOC environment to ingest external threat feeds (IP addresses, domains, file hashes, etc.) for proactive detection of emerging threats.
•	Custom Threat Intelligence Feeds: Allow the system to dynamically pull threat intelligence data, correlate it with internal logs, and use that information to enhance alerts and incident response automation. For example, correlating suspicious IP addresses with known malware sources can improve detection accuracy.
2. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) for Threat Detection
•	Anomaly Detection: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical event data and identify anomalies or unusual behavior that could indicate a potential security threat. Tools like ML-Spark, Scikit-learn, or TensorFlow can be integrated to build custom detection models.
•	Behavioral Analytics: Implement User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to detect abnormal behavior patterns (e.g., lateral movement, privilege escalation) within your SOC lab. Tools like Cortex XSOAR or Splunk UEBA could help here.
•	AI-based Threat Prediction: Leverage predictive analytics to forecast potential threats based on emerging attack patterns. This could be used for advanced persistent threat (APT) detection.
3. Advanced Incident Response (IR) Automation
•	SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response): Beyond Shuffle, you could integrate a more comprehensive SOAR platform like Cortex XSOAR or Demisto, which can automate complex incident response workflows, and provide a centralized platform for orchestrating responses across multiple security tools.
•	Automated Remediation: For incidents, allow the lab to perform automated remediation actions (e.g., quarantine infected endpoints, block IP addresses, disable accounts) based on predefined rules, reducing the need for human intervention.
•	Automated Playbooks: Create custom incident response playbooks (e.g., for ransomware, phishing, or insider threats) and automate them within the lab. This ensures consistency and reduces human error during critical incidents.
4. Cloud Security Integration
•	Cloud SIEM Integration: Integrate cloud-native security tools such as AWS GuardDuty, Azure Sentinel, or Google Chronicle to collect logs and analyze activities in cloud environments, simulating the unique security challenges of modern multi-cloud infrastructures.
•	Cloud Incident Response Automation: Extend your automation workflows to cloud-based services. For example, if an alert is triggered from a cloud resource, the system could automatically block traffic, isolate instances, or trigger cloud-native security controls.
